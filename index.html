        <h2>Beauty of Nature</h2>
        <p>
            Nature is made of everything we see around us – trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests and
            more. <u><i> Human beings depend on nature to stay alive.</i></u> Nature helps us breathe, gives us food, water, shelter,
            medicines, and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.

            Animals, fish and insects also get their food and shelter from nature. Different trees grow up due to
            sunlight and water provided by nature. Humans should stop causing harm to the elements of nature for their
            needs. Nature is very important to maintain the growth and balance of life on earth.

        <h2>Nature Explore</h2>
        <p>
            As the name implies, Exploring Nature outings are trips where the focus is on observing and learning about
            the natural world around us. Exploring Nature trips sometimes take place in the city or are focused on
            naturalist activities such as photographing wildflowers, lichens or seabird in the wild.

            Nature includes living and non-living components that together make life on Earth possible. Some forms of
            nature can be seen through the lush green forests, the vast sky above us, the oceans without an end, the
            mountains standing tall and so on. Nature nourishes the survival needs of plants, animals and humans alike.
            It provides the essential components of oxygen, sunlight, soil and water.

            My name is Huneshwar Kumar, I am 25 years old and have always enjoyed spending time outside. From going on
            hikes with my family, to climbing the tree in our backyard or even swimming at the beach where my Grampa and
            Nana live. I just like being outside whenever and wherever I can! The one thing I enjoy the most about
            nature though is being surrounded by the forest. There is just something about how the forest surrounds me
            that makes me feel at home, it’s a peaceful and calm place that makes me happy. I like to close my eyes and
            take it all in. You can smell the moss on the trees, hear the sounds of a stream running close by and you
            can feel the forest floor beneath your feet. It’s comforting like a cozy blanket on a cold day.
            <br><br>


            Being outside in nature makes me feel happy when I’m sad. It gives my brain a chance to relax and reset.
            Personally I tend to overthink situations and sometimes thinking about things so much makes me feel anxious
            and I’ve found that being outdoors helps me cope with some of these feelings. The things you can learn and
            discover by being outside isn’t something that can be taught in a typical classroom.
            <br><br>


            Since I’ve become a student of the Wildlings outdoor school I’ve felt that it has helped me in multiple
            ways, including taking my mind off of recent events going on in the world like the Pandemic. By going to
            school outside it has given me a chance to explore and learn more about nature and at the same time also
            help me develop my outdoor skill set. I hope to continue my outdoor education and be able to pass along my
            knowledge and love of the outdoors to other people.
            <br><br>


            This is what being outdoors means to me; listening to the earth, discovering new things but most of all
            being happy and enjoying the natural world!





            I wish everyone peace, love and happiness ~ Huneshwar</p>
